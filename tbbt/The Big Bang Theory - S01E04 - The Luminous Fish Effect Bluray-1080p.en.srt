1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,754
You know, I've been thinking
about time travel again.

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,757
Why? Did you hit a roadblock
with invisibility?

3
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:11,468
Put it on the back burner.

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:15,639
Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,933
... I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:21,645
Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,816
-Interesting.
-Yeah, it really takes the pressure off.

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,818
Sounds like a breakthrough.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,487
Should I call Science
and tell them to hold the cover?

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,990
It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

11
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,910
I guess congratulations are in order.

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:41,040
No, congratulations
will have been in order.

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,208
You know,
I'm not going to enjoy this party.

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,335
I know, I'm familiar with you.

15
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,338
The last party,
Professor Finkleday cornered me.. .

16
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,841
...and talked about spelunking
for 45 minutes.

17
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:52,051
Yes, I was there.

18
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,053
You know what's interesting
about caves?

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,555
-What?
-Nothing.

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:01,810
We'll avoid Finkleday, meet the new head,
congratulate him, shake his hand and go.

21
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,938
How's this?
"Pleased to meet you, Dr. Gablehauser.

22
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,983
How fortunate for you
the university has chosen to hire you...

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:11,236
...despite the fact you've done
no original research in 25 years. . .

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,322
...and instead have written books.. .

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,408
...that reduce the great concepts
of science to anecdotes.. .

26
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,785
...each one dumbed down...

27
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:21,705
...to accommodate the duration
of an average bowel movement."

28
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,922
-"Mahalo" is a nice touch.
-Hmm.

29
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,508
Only eight consonants
in the Hawaiian language.

30
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,010
Interesting, you should lead with that.

31
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,848
Oh, God, look at this buffet.

32
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,850
I love America.

33
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,230
-You don't have buffets in India?
-Of course, but it's all Indian food.

34
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:49,399
You can't find a bagel in Mumbai
to save your life.

35
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,360
Smear me.

36
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,864
-Well, here's an interesting turn of events.
-What?

37
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,868
Howard brought a date?

38
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,915
A more plausible explanation is that his
work in robotics has made an amazing leap.

39
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,794
Hey, what up, science bitches?

40
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,881
May I introduce my special lady friend,
Summer.

41
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,800
Howard, I told you, touching's extra.

44
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,515
Hi, fellas.

45
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,559
-Eric Gablehauser.
-Howard Wolowitz.

46
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,436
Howard, nice to meet you. And you are?

47
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,773
An actual real scientist.

48
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,611
How was that?

49
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,574
I can't believe he fired me.

50
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,118
You did call him
a glorified science teacher...

51
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,873
...whose last successful experiment
was lighting his own farts.

52
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,711
In my defense, I prefaced that by saying
"with all due respect."

53
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,656
Morning.

54
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,867
You're making eggs for breakfast?

55
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,037
This isn't breakfast, it's an experiment.

56
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,582
Oh. Because it looks a lot like breakfast.

57
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,628
I finally have time to test my hypothesis
about the separation of water molecules...

58
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,381
...from the egg proteins
and its impact vis-à-vis taste.

59
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,801
Sounds yummy.

60
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,054
I look forward to your work with bacon.

61
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,056
As do I .

62
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,977
You know, I'm sure if you just apologize
to Gablehauser he'd give your job back.

63
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,896
I don't want my job back.

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,983
I've spent three and a half years
staring at grease boards full of equations.

65
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,569
Before that,
I spent four years working on my thesis.

66
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,907
Before that, I was in college,
and before that I was in the fifth grade.

67
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,495
This is my first day off in decades
and I’m going to savor it.

68
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,540
Okay. I’ll let you get back
to fixing your eggs.

69
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,919
I'm not just fixing my eggs,
I'm fixing everyone's eggs.

70
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,964
And we all thank you.

71
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,664
Use new eggs.

72
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,211
Hi, I’m running out to the market.
Do you guys need anything?

73
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:59,089
Oh. This would be
one of those circumstances. . .

74
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:02,801
...people unfamiliar with the law
of large numbers would call a coincidence.

75
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,720
-I'm sorry?
-I need eggs.

76
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,930
-Four dozen should suffice.
-Four dozen?

77
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:12,519
Evenly distributed amongst brown, white,
free-range, large, extra-large and jumbo.

78
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,480
-Okay, one more time?
-Never mind, you won't get it right.

79
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,859
I'd better come with you.

80
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,403
Oh, yay.

81
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,200
How come
you didn't go in to work today?

82
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,705
I'm taking a sabbatical because
I won't kowtow to mediocre minds.

83
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,915
So you got canned, huh?

84
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,169
Theoretical physicists do not get canned.

85
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,087
But, yeah.

86
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,256
Maybe it's for the best.

87
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,509
You know, I always say, "When one door
closes, another one opens."

88
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,720
No, it doesn't.

89
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,348
Not unless the doors
are connected by relays.

90
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,933
-Or there are motion sensors involved.
-No, I meant--

91
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,521
Or if the first door closing creates a change
of air pressure that acts upon the second.

92
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,732
Never mind.

93
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:03,070
Slow down. Slow down.
Please, slow down.

94
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,279
We're fine.

95
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,490
You're not leaving
enough space between cars.

96
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,699
Oh, sure I am.

97
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,534
No, no, let me do the math for you.

98
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,120
This car weighs, let's say, 4000 pounds.

99
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,206
Now, add 1 40 for me, 1 20 for you--

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,417
-One-twenty?
-Oh, I'm sorry, did I insult you?

101
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,420
Is your body mass
somehow tied into your self-worth?

102
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,756
Well, yeah.

103
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,965
Interesting.

104
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,511
Anyway, that gives us a total weight of,
let's say, 4400 pounds.

105
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,805
Let's say 4390.

106
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,348
Fine.

107
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,935
We're traveling forward at--
Good Lord. --51 miles an hour.

108
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,480
Let's assume that your brakes are new
and the calipers are aligned.

109
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,315
By the time we come to a stop. . .

110
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,068
...we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick.

111
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,988
An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and--

112
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:50,909
Oh, look,
they built a new putt-putt course.

113
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,704
This is great.

114
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,707
Look at me.
I'm in the real world of ordinary people. . .

115
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,628
...just living their ordinary,
colorless, work-a-day lives.

116
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,006
-Thank you.
-No, thank you.

117
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,510
And thank you, ordinary person.

118
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:12,139
Hey, you wanna hear an interesting thing
about tomatoes?

119
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,473
No. No, not really.

120
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,518
Listen, didn't you say
you needed some eggs?

121
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,021
Yes, but anyone who knows anything
about bacterial growth. . .

122
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:23,150
...knows to pick up their refrigerated foods
on the way out.

123
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,111
Oh, okay, maybe you should start
heading on out, then.

124
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,364
No, this is fun.

125
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,367
The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...

126
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,787
...is they're shelved with the vegetables,
but they're technically a fruit.

127
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,205
-Hmm. Interesting.
-Isn't it?

128
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,041
No, I mean what you find enjoyable.

129
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,505
Oh, boy.

130
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,050
What now?

131
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:51,761
Well, there's some value
to taking a multivitamin. . .

132
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,139
...but the human body
can only absorb so much.

133
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:59,186
What you're buying here
are the ingredients for very expensive urine.

134
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,814
Well, maybe that's what I was going for.

135
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,816
Well, then you'll want some manganese.

136
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,991
Well, that was fun.

137
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,619
Tomorrow we can go
to one of those warehouse stores.

138
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,870
I don't know, Sheldon.

139
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,374
It's gonna take me a while to recover
from all the fun I had today.

140
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,212
Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.

141
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,797
For example, I noticed
you purchase your tampons...

142
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,424
...one month's supply at a time.

143
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,970
-What?
-Well, think about it.

144
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,555
It doesn't spoil. . .

145
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,267
...and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

146
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,854
You want me to buy
30 years' worth of tampons?

147
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,105
Well, 30, 35--

148
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,067
-When did your mother go into menopause?
-Okay.

149
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,569
I'm not talking about this with you.

150
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,820
Oh, Penny.

151
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,908
This is a natural human process
and we're talking about significant savings.

152
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,787
Now, if you assume 1 5 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle--

153
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,747
Are you fairly regular?

154
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,381
Okay, no warehouse store,
but we're still on for putt-putt golf, right?

155
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,056
Hey, I just ran into Penny.
She seemed upset about something.

156
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,725
I think it's her time of the month.

157
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,564
I marked the calendar
for future reference.

158
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,944
What's with the fish?

159
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,613
It's an experiment.

160
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,409
-What happened to your egg research?
-Oh, that was a dead end.

161
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,662
Scrambled eggs are as good
as they're ever going to be.

162
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,999
So fish.

163
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,628
I read an article about scientists
who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish...

164
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:54,301
...into other animals, and I thought,
"Hey, fish nightlights."

165
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,013
Fish nightlights.

166
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,266
It's a billion-dollar idea. Shhh!

167
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,143
Mum's the word.

168
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,065
Are you sure you don't wanna just apologize
to Gablehauser and get your job back?

169
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,860
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I have too much to do.

170
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,154
Like luminous fish.

171
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,198
-Shhh!
-I'm sorry, I didn't....

172
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,784
That's just the beginning.

173
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,205
I also have an idea for a bulk,
mail-order feminine hygiene company.

174
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,791
Oh, glow-in-the-dark tampons.

175
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,880
Leonard, we're gonna be rich.

176
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:39,095
-Thanks for coming on such short notice.
-You did the right thing calling.

177
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,473
I didn't know what to do.
He's lost all focus.

178
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,476
Every day, he's got a new obsession.

179
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,234
This is a particularly disturbing one.

180
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,364
Mommy?

181
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,909
Hi, baby.

182
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,578
You called my mother?

183
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,089
Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.

184
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,093
-Thank you.
-Honey, why did you get a loom?

185
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:23,682
I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "Hey...

186
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,267
...loom."

187
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,938
Mom, what are you doing here?

188
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,523
Leonard called me.

189
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,817
I know, but why?

190
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,444
Because one of the great minds
of the 21 st century...

191
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,823
...is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.

192
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,784
This is not a serape. This is a poncho.

193
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,121
A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.

194
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,417
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.

195
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,253
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?

196
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,505
I went to the market with Penny.

197
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,424
Yeah, that was three weeks ago.

198
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:58,633
Well, then, buckle up.

199
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,887
In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,267
Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.

201
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,727
Yes, well, I’m not a child.

202
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,980
I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.

203
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,316
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.

204
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,027
Wait, where are you going?

205
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,239
To my room and no one's allowed in.

206
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,326
-He gets his temper from his daddy.
-Ah.

207
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,871
-He's got my eyes.
-I see.

208
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,583
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.

209
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,421
Sheldon, your mom made dinner.

210
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,630
I'm not hungry.

211
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,717
Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.

212
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,969
He may stay in there till the rapture.

213
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,806
Are we so sure that's a bad thing?

214
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,433
I love the boy to death...

215
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:52,687
...but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.

216
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,065
Excuse me for being so bold...

217
00:12:56,233 --> 00:13:00,069
...but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.

218
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:04,282
Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.

219
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,868
I made chicken.

220
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:12,040
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.

221
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,048
You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.

222
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,467
A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.

223
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,013
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.

224
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,098
You know, those that needed it.

225
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,559
That is a lovely story.

226
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,478
Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?

227
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,189
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.

228
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,525
His father, God rest his soul, used to say:

229
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,903
"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."

230
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,573
-Sounds like a wise man.
-Oh, not so wise.

231
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,827
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.

232
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:55,250
So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.

233
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,752
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?

234
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,962
Oh, all the time.

235
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,339
I remember one summer
when he was 1 3...

236
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,634
...he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...

237
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,929
...and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.

238
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:12,517
Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.

239
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,187
Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...

240
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,817
...a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle. . .

241
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,779
...and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.

242
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,324
-Well, what happened?
-Well, poor boy had a fit.

243
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,661
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.

244
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,956
-A death ray?
-Well, that's what he called it.

245
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,292
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.

246
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,795
It pissed our dog off to no end.

247
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,133
You know, you two make a cute couple.

248
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,429
I-- No, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.

249
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:54,642
Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that....

250
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,021
Or friends.

251
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,315
-Did I pluck a nerve there?
-Oh, yeah.

252
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:03,109
Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.

253
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,324
Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.

254
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,995
And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.

255
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,416
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name". . .

256
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,336
...but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.

257
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,424
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

258
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,019
Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

259
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,856
It was always Sheldon's favorite.
You know what the secret ingredient is?

260
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,566
-Love?
-Lard.

261
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,200
-Hey, look who's com--
-Shh. You'll spook him.

262
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,871
He's like a baby deer.
You gotta let him come to you.

263
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,589
This is ridiculous.

264
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,383
Damn it, Sheldon, snap out of it.

265
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,720
You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

266
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,813
You don't hunt, do you?

267
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,531
Good morning, Snickerdoodle.

268
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,907
-Morning.
-Oh.

269
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,618
Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

270
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,333
It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.

271
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:47,171
But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

272
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,258
What do you want, Mom?

273
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:54,637
You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long . . .

274
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,682
...before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

275
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,977
-Yeah?
-Well, I’m done fishing.

276
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,605
-You put those on.
-What for?

277
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,649
Because you're gonna go
to your office...

278
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,360
...apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

279
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,945
-No.
-I'm sorry.

280
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,241
Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?

281
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,662
I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

282
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,205
Now, you listen here.

283
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,875
I have been telling you since you were 4.

284
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:28,004
It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.

285
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,965
-Why not?
-Because people don't like it.

286
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,094
Remember all the ass-kickings
from the neighbor kids?

287
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,849
Now, let's get cracking.

288
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:43,978
Shower, shirt, shoes and let's shove off.

289
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:50,151
Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

290
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,157
Problem solved.

291
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,868
Really? That's impressive.

292
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:01,829
Leonard, the Lord never gives us
more than we can handle.

293
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,415
Thankfully, he blessed me
with two other children...

294
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
...who are dumb as soup.

295
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,883
Excuse me, Dr. Gablehauser,
are you busy?

296
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,054
-Well, actually--
-Sheldon, he's just doodling. Get in here.

297
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,184
-Dr. Gablehauser.
-Dr. Cooper.

298
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,021
Let's go, baby, we're losing daylight.

299
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,192
Um....

300
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,530
As you know, several weeks ago
in our first encounter...

301
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,907
...we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot.. .

302
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,617
...when I called you an idiot.

303
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,454
And I just wanted to say
that I was wrong. . .

304
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,415
...to point it out.

305
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,961
I'm sorry, we haven't been introduced.

306
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,548
-Dr. Eric Gablehauser.
-Mary Cooper, Sheldon's mom.

307
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:57,009
Now, that's impossible. You must've
had him when you were a teenager.

308
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,512
Oh, aren't you sweet. His father's dead.

309
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,267
-Recently?
-Long enough.

310
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,019
Please.

311
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,397
Sheldon, shouldn't you be working?

312
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,945
Okay.

313
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,617
Hey, how did it go?

314
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,578
I got my job back.

315
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,913
Really? What happened?

316
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,583
I'm not quite sure.

317
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,337
It involves a part of the human experience
that has always eluded me.

318
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,132
Well, that narrows it down.

319
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,764
I'm very proud of you, honey.
You showed a lot of courage today.

320
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,225
Thanks, Mom.

321
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,230
-Mom?
-Mm-hm.

322
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,068
Is Dr. Gablehauser
going to be my new daddy?

323
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,116
We'll see. Sleep tight.
