1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,420
Okay.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,256
The X Tens are online.

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,387
Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP...

4
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,016
...racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,519
...bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,814
Data packets will be handed off
to submerged transatlantic cables...

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,899
...terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia...

8
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,737
...and transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP...

9
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,114
...and the external receiver attached
to this...

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,533
...lamp.

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,163
Look at me, look at me,
I've got goose bumps.

12
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,249
-Are we ready on the stereo?
-Go for stereo.

13
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,379
A SPACE ODYSSEY'S "MAIN TITLE"
PLAYS OVER SPEAKERS]

14
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:06,482
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

15
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,108
It's a little loud.

16
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,486
No problem. Turning it down.

17
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:13,822
San Francisco, Lisbon, Halifax:

18
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,407
Voilà.

19
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,617
Okay, thanks.

20
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,286
Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realize what we just did?

21
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,872
Yeah, you turned your stereo down
with your laptop.

22
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,960
No, we turned our stereo down by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,297
Oh. Get one of those
universal remotes at RadioShack.

24
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,049
They're really cheap.

25
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,926
No. You don't get it.

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,637
Howard, enable public access.

27
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,305
Public access enabled.

28
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,561
-Boy, that's terrific, but I'll see you.
-No, hang on.

29
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,066
See?

30
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,693
No.

31
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,154
Someone in Sichuan Province, China...

32
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:58,075
...is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off.

33
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,577
Huh. Well, that's handy.

34
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,705
Um, here's a question. Why?

35
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,959
Because we can.

36
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,087
Oh! They found the remote-control cars.

37
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,760
-But wait, wait, what's on top of them?
-Wireless webcams. Wave hello.

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,222
The monster truck
is out of Austin, Texas...

39
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,268
...and the blue Viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.

40
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,605
You may wanna put on slacks.

41
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,065
What?

44
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:09,688
You know, in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars...

45
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,400
...we're going to look back on this
as eight hours well wasted.

46
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,906
I don't wanna be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

47
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,617
Eight feet tall and ripped.

48
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,872
I'm with you. I just have to make sure
if I'm a synthetic human, I'd still be Jewish.

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,584
I promised my mother.

50
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:36,757
I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.

51
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,136
That's something your rabbi would have
to discuss with the manufacturer.

52
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,973
Not to mention
you'd have to power down on Saturdays.

53
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,477
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?

54
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,479
Well, there's always the possibility...

55
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,482
...that a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...

56
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:57,527
...but Ockham's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.

57
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,988
It's from the Institute
for Experimental Physics.

58
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,325
They want us to present our
paper on the properties of supersolids...

59
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,161
...at the Topical Conference
on Bose-Einstein Condensates.

60
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,331
I know. I read it before I threw it out.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,292
Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,752
...why did you throw it out?

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,798
Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott...

64
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,217
...in front of a group
of judgmental strangers...

65
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,471
...who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.

66
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,099
Which, if I were there, it would be.

67
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,850
I don't know, Sheldon.

68
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:32,813
Those Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein
Condensates parties are legendary.

69
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,314
Forget the parties.

70
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,442
Forget the parties? What a nerd.

71
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,862
Any other honors I've gotten
that I don't know about?

72
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,991
Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize
with my name on it?

73
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,661
Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel Prize...

74
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,457
...is the day I begin my research on the
drag coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.

75
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,045
Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from
that insult was your mama.

76
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,300
I got one. Hey, Leonard, your mama's
research methodology is so flawed--

77
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,218
Shut up, Howard.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,971
-Sheldon, we have to do this.
-No, we don't.

79
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,348
We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...

80
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,143
...and inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.

81
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,312
Everything else is optional.

82
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,564
I'm doing it.

83
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,816
You can't. I'm the lead author.

84
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,778
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.

85
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,864
I let you think we went alphabetically...

86
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,825
...to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.

87
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,495
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.

88
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,247
You're welcome.

89
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,834
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.

90
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,419
It doesn't need proving.

91
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,340
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?

92
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,259
They're not supposed to,
but they should.

93
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,635
I don't care what you say.

94
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:48,263
I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.

95
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,598
And I forbid it.

96
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,351
You forbid it?

97
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,395
If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.

98
00:05:55,563 --> 00:06:00,150
-So you admit that it's our work?
-No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.

99
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,944
And once again, you are welcome.

100
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,241
Oh, no, he didn't.

101
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,289
So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?

102
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,459
Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...

103
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,629
...where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.

104
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,425
You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?

105
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,927
Bzz-phew!

106
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,721
Never mind.

107
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,057
How about this one?

108
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,227
It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy."

109
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,478
Oh.

110
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,523
Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.

111
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,275
They don't. That's why I saved this one.

112
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:46,071
Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.

113
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:51,284
Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...

114
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,912
-...and these.
-Is this stuff you want me to try on?

115
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,790
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.

116
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,961
Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.

117
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,213
What's this?

118
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,841
That's the Bottle City of Kandor.

119
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,843
Uh-huh.

120
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,639
You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.

121
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,475
It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...

122
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,436
...and then rescued by Superman.

123
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,064
Oh, nice.

124
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,359
It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.

125
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,780
Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?

126
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,616
-Great, be right back.
-Where are you going? Put them on.

127
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,619
-Here?
-Oh, are you shy?

128
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,038
-No, I'm not shy.
-Don't worry, I won't look.

129
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,542
I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth--

130
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,503
-Sweetie, put the pants on.
-I'm gonna put them on.

131
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,924
So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...

132
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,509
...on this presentation thing?

133
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,387
No, no. Scientists do not compromise.

134
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:56,391
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.

135
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,770
Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.

136
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,399
What is this?

137
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,693
Oh, careful.

138
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,738
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.

139
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,074
Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?

140
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:16,328
Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.

141
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,832
Okay, all right. Moving on.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,168
Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.

143
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,170
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.

144
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,342
If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.

145
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,178
Is this your only tie?

146
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,138
Ah, technically, yes.

147
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:39,935
But if you'll notice, it's reversible.

148
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,896
So it works as two.

149
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,690
Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.

150
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,071
-Is this all your clothes?
-Yup, everything since the eighth grade.

151
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,240
The eighth grade?

152
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,200
My last growth spurt.

153
00:08:56,994 --> 00:08:59,621
Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.

154
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,957
-Great.
-Yup.

155
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,544
I said no. Put it down.

156
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,218
Hey, Sheldon.

157
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,470
Hello, Penny.

158
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,306
Get anything good?

159
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,894
Just the latest copy
of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.

160
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,399
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.

161
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,446
It was a joke.

162
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,116
Heh-heh.

163
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,289
Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.

164
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,542
To save you from further awkwardness...

165
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,504
...know that I'm comfortable with
the two of us climbing the stairs in silence.

166
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,965
Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.

167
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,761
Put it in your pocket.

168
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,560
-So you and Leonard--
-Oh, dear God.

169
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,645
Little misunderstanding, huh?

170
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,230
A little misunderstand--?

171
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,318
Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.

172
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,281
Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...

173
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,700
...and I think he feels really bad about it.

174
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,201
Huh.

175
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,537
Well, how do you feel?

176
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,332
I don't understand the question.

177
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,753
Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.

178
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,714
Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.

179
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,925
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

180
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,429
...of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.

181
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:40,889
Wait, what?

182
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,558
I couldn't poop this morning.

183
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,482
You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

184
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,735
-It's certainly preferable to my plan.
-Which was?

185
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,071
A powerful laxative.

186
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,407
Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.

187
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,368
I know Leonard values you as a friend.

188
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,411
He told me without your little idea...

189
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,040
...there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.

190
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,920
Excuse me. Little idea?

191
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,131
Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it--

192
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,259
Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?

193
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,471
Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words--

194
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,515
In what words, then, exactly?

195
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,183
The exact words aren't really--

196
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,727
-It's more the spirit in which--
-What did he say?

197
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,187
You had a lucky hunch.

198
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,358
I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why--?

199
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,069
Don't you ever speak to me again.

200
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,322
What--?

201
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,076
Oh, he:

202
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,881
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.

203
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,219
-Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."
-Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.

204
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,012
-Why did you say it?
-I don't know--

205
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,974
-Were you trying to impress Penny?
-No, no, not at all.

206
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,642
A little bit.

207
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,978
How did that work out for you?

208
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,396
Leonard, ready to go?

209
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,858
Libido, one. Truth, zero.

210
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,902
I'm gonna ask one more time.

211
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,780
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.

212
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:25,869
And I'm telling you for the last time,
it's pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.

213
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,997
Let's go.

214
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,082
-Bye, Sheldon.
-Goodbye, Penny.

215
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,304
Phew!

216
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,349
There you go.

217
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,393
You're right, this side does look better.

218
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,855
No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.

219
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:58,234
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.

220
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,861
-You're kidding.
-Is that all?

221
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,032
All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.

222
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,619
Oh. Well, then, good.

223
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,954
I wasn't expecting such a crowd.
I'm nervous.

224
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,459
-It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
-Okay, joke. Okay.

225
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,045
How about this? Um, okay.

226
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,381
There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...

227
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,050
...but they won't lay any eggs.

228
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,886
So he calls a physicist to help.

229
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:30,099
The physicist then does some calculations
and he says:

230
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:35,897
"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."

231
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,734
Right?

232
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,407
Oh, sorry, I just-- I've heard it before.

233
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,368
-Let's roll.
-Okay.

234
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,204
-Hey, nice suit.
-It's a classic, right?

235
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,999
I really should've brought my own car.

236
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:01,130
So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...

237
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,759
...the moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...

238
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:09,764
...which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter.

239
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,560
Thank you.

240
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,941
- Are there any questions?
- Yeah.

241
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,652
What the hell was that?

242
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,989
Any other questions?

243
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,702
Dr. Sheldon Cooper here.
I am the lead author of this particular paper.

244
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,414
Thank you.

245
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,126
And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...

246
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,211
...where I was walking through
the park...

247
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,630
...and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...

248
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,508
...which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...

249
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,761
...in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.

250
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,598
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.

251
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,767
Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.

252
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,185
Was that just an anecdote?

253
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,563
-You are not Isaac Newton.
-No, no, that's true.

254
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,482
Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.

255
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,234
You cannot be that arrogant.

256
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,029
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.

257
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,158
If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.

258
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,537
As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.

259
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,040
-No offense.
-Really? So why did you come?

260
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,918
-Because I knew you'd screw this up.
-I didn't screw it up.

261
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,254
Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.

262
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,673
-Thank you.
-It was straight downhill from there.

263
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,800
I've had enough of your condescension.

264
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,678
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.

265
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,182
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.

266
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,353
But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.

267
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,855
No offense.

268
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:45,026
And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...

269
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,445
...and has an ego
in need of constant validation.

270
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,531
-So you admit you're an egotist.
-Yes.

271
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,619
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...

272
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:57,038
...so I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.

273
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,289
But he's worse!

274
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,999
Okay, that is it.

275
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,876
Stop it.

276
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,255
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.

277
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:08,383
Then I'll settle for an aneurism.

278
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,301
-Stop it.
-You hit me.

279
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,719
You saw that. He hit me.

280
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,222
-You tried to blow up my head.
-So it was working.

281
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,474
It wasn't-- It was not--
You are a nutcase.

282
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,978
We'll see. Heads up, you people
in the front row. This is a splash zone.

283
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,896
Stop it. Stop it.

284
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,898
Quit it.

285
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,572
Is this usually
how these physics things go?

286
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,075
More often than you'd think.

287
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,246
Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.

288
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,872
-No pinches. No--!
-No!

289
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,301
You could have offered me a ride home.

290
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,763
You're lucky I didn't run you over.

291
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,182
I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.

292
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,853
You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.

293
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,647
You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.

294
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:07,775
Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

295
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,111
Excuse me.

296
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,197
Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?

297
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,533
Yes. Ahem.

298
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,619
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.

299
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,789
It was uncalled for.

300
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,458
You won't believe this.

301
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,878
Somebody got the whole thing
on their cell phone and put it on YouTube.

302
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,796
What?

303
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,925
-Now, who would do that?
-That would be me.

304
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,470
Check it out. It's a featured video.

305
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,305
You hit me. You saw that. He hit me.

306
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,724
-You tried to blow up my head.
-So it was working.

307
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,435
-It was not-- You are a nutcase.
-We'll see about that.

308
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,105
You people in the front row, heads up.
This is a splash zone.

309
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,401
Stop it. Quit it. Quit it.

310
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:56,115
-Hit you with a Vulcan nerve pinch.
-No pinches. No--!

311
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,160
You should clip your fingernails.
Those hurt.

312
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,329
Oh, jeez.

313
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,956
Does this suit really look that bad?

314
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,000
Forget your suit.
Look at my arms waving.

315
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,711
I'm like a flamingo on Ritalin.

316
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,174
Howard, would you like
to explain to me...

317
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,178
...why your Facebook page has a picture
of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned:

318
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,013
"Me and my girlfriend"?

319
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,559
Uh-oh, here comes the talk.

320
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,654
-He hit me.
-You tried to blow up my head.

321
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,448
-So it was working.
-It was not-- You are a nutcase.

322
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,699
We'll see about that.
