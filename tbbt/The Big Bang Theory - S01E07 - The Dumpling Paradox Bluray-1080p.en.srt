1
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,087
Watch this, it's really cool. Ahem.

2
00:00:05,255 --> 00:00:07,339
Call Leonard Hofstadter.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,427
Did you say, "Call Helen Boxleitner"?

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,307
No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.

5
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,186
Did you say, "Call Temple Beth Seder"?

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,773
-No.
-Here, let me try.

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,528
Call M'kflono M'kflooniloo. Ha-ha. Ha.

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,322
Calling Rajesh Koothrappali.

9
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,123
Oh. It's very impressive.

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,500
And a little racist.

11
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:47,087
If we're through playing
Mock the Flawed Technology...

12
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:48,797
...can we get on with "Halo" night?

13
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,050
We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.

14
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,634
So we'll start now.

15
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,887
We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...

16
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,973
...will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,933
We could split it two, two and two.

18
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:03,145
If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.

19
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,398
What fresh hell is this?

20
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,359
-Hey, Penny. Come on in.
-Hey, guys.

21
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:13,989
See a Penny, pick her up,
and all the day, you'll have good luck.

22
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,410
No, you won't. Uh....

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,413
-Can I hide out here for a while?
-Sure. What's going on?

24
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,458
Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.

25
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,169
She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California?"

26
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,671
And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.

27
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,716
The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

28
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,594
-Eight oh eight.
-Shh.

29
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,972
She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,227
...yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...

31
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,938
...and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:48,023
...you have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.

33
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,443
Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?

34
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,363
Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

35
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,450
-He really needs to dial it down.
-I know.

36
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,913
So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?

37
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,958
She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...

38
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,417
...so she's kind of family.

39
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,213
Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.

40
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,257
Who needs "Halo"
when we can be regaled...

41
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,468
...with the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

44
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,851
I mean, she has absolutely no standards.

45
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,270
This one time, she was at....

46
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,604
Where's Howard?

47
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,022
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

48
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,983
I understand you're new in town.

49
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,819
Oh, good grief.

50
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:08,604
Ugh. I cannot believe Christy let Howard
into my apartment.

51
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,273
And I cannot believe people pay
for horoscopes...

52
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,777
...but on a more serious note,
it's 8:13 and we're still not playing "Halo."

53
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,822
Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.

54
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,741
One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.

55
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,703
We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.

56
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,333
Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut Raj in half.

57
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,587
Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

58
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,006
Hey, if you guys need a fourth, I'll play.

59
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,717
-Great idea.
-Uh, no.

60
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,805
The wheel was a great idea.
Relativity was a great idea.

61
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,892
This is a notion,
and a rather sucky one at that.

62
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,811
-Why?
-Why? Oh....

63
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,398
-Penny, Penny, Penny.
-What, what, what?

64
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,735
This is a complex battle simulation
with a steep learning curve.

65
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,488
There are myriad weapons,
vehicles and strategies to master...

66
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,490
...not to mention an intricate back-story.

67
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,161
Oh, cool!
Whose head did I just blow off?

68
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,829
Mine.

69
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:12,167
Okay, I got this. Lock and load, boys.

70
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,795
It's the only way we can play teams.

71
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,257
Whoever's her partner will be hamstrung
by her lack of experience, not to mention--

72
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:21,551
Ha-ha! There goes your head again.

73
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,764
Okay, it's not good sportsmanship
to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

74
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,849
You need to give them a chance to--
Now, come on.

75
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,144
Raj, Raj, she's got me cornered.
Cover me.

76
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,438
Cover this, suckers.

77
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,899
Penny, you are on fire.

78
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,193
Yeah, and so is Sheldon.

79
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,823
Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.

80
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:46,576
No one can be that attractive
and this skilled at a video game.

81
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,954
Wait, Sheldon, come back.
You forgot something.

82
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,205
What?

83
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,082
This plasma grenade.

84
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,920
Ha! Look, it's raining you.

85
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:01,591
You laugh now,
you just wait until you need tech support.

86
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,554
Gosh. He's kind of a sore loser, isn't he?

87
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:09,224
Well, to be fair,
he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

88
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,226
Well, it's been fun.

89
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,186
Penny, we make such a good team.

90
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,148
Maybe we could enter
a couple of "Halo" tournaments sometime.

91
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,109
Or we could just have a life.

92
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,779
I guess for you, that's an option.
Ha-ha. Ha.

93
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,740
-Good night, Leonard.
-Good night.

94
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,409
As usual, nice talking to you, Raj.

95
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,871
What do you suppose she meant by that?

96
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,498
She's an enigma, Raj.

97
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,252
There's a certain ethic to the game,
Penny, a well-established--

98
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,254
She's gone, Sheldon.

99
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,965
Well, she could have said goodbye.

100
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,218
Okay, I have a problem.

101
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,638
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome,
and quite frankly, you deserve it.

102
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,391
What's wrong?

103
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:57,356
Well, um, Howard and Christy
are kind of hooking up in my bedroom.

104
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,901
-Are you sure?
-Look, I grew up on a farm, okay?

105
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,988
From what I heard, they're either having sex
or Howard's caught in a milking machine.

106
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,493
Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

107
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,871
No. Yeah, take the couch, or my bed.
I just got new pillows.

108
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,290
Hypoallergenic.

109
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,167
Uh, the couch is good.

110
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,628
Hold that thought. Leonard, a moment.

111
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,175
You have a problem with this.

112
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,385
Where do I begin?

113
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,388
It's up to you. Crazy person's choice.

114
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,890
Well, first, we don't have house guests.

115
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,102
Frankly, if I could afford the rent,
I'd ask you to leave.

116
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,522
Your friendship means a lot
to me as well. What else?

117
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,358
Well, our earthquake supplies.

118
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,944
-We have a two-man, two-day kit.
-So?

119
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,364
So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...

120
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,534
...we could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.

121
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,412
Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...

122
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,705
...we might succumb to cannibalism?

123
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,750
No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.

124
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:04,881
Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh
off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

125
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:10,178
-Ha. What?
-He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.

126
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,599
It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...

127
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,853
...and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.

128
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,106
I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

129
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,735
Okay, since I'm obviously being ignored
here, let's go over the morning schedule.

130
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,447
I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

131
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,074
Plan your ablutions
and bodily functions accordingly.

132
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,870
How am I supposed to
plan my bodily functions?

133
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,289
I suggest no liquids after 11p.m.

134
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,959
-Here you go.
-Thanks, Leonard.

135
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,087
Heh, wrong.

136
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,966
I'm listening.

137
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,093
Your head goes on the other end.

138
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,262
-Why?
-It's culturally universal.

139
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,222
A bed, even a temporary bed...

140
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,142
...is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.

141
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,063
It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

142
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,902
-I'll risk it.
-Ooh.

143
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,445
Anything else I should know?

144
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,574
Yes. If you use my toothbrush,
I'll jump out that window.

145
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,912
Please don't come to my funeral.
Have a good night.

146
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,583
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

147
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,129
FYI, his toothbrush is the red one
in the Plexiglas case under the UV light.

148
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,716
-Ha. Got it.
-Well, sleep tight.

149
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,676
Thanks.

150
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,432
Funny expression, sleep tight. Ha-ha. Ha.

151
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,019
It refers to
the early construction of beds...

152
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,981
...which featured a mattress suspended
on interlocking ropes, which occasionally--

153
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,692
Sleep tight.

154
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,768
What are you doing?

155
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,859
Every Saturday since we've lived in
this apartment I have awakened at 6:15...

156
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,695
...poured a bowl of cereal,
added a quarter cup of milk...

157
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,575
...sat on this end of this couch, turned on
BBC America, and watched Doctor Who.

158
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,452
Penny's still sleeping.

159
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,539
Every Saturday
since we've lived in this apartment...

160
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,666
... I have awakened at 6:15,
poured myself--

161
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,960
I know.
Look, you have a TV in your room.

162
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,795
Why don't you have breakfast in bed?

163
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,008
Because I am neither an invalid
nor a woman celebrating Mother's Day.

164
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,178
What time is it?

165
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,138
Almost 6:30.

166
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,265
I slept all day?

167
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,726
No, it's 6:30 in the morning.

168
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,896
What the hell is your problem?

169
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,566
Okay, this cereal
has lost all its molecular integrity.

170
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,569
I now have a bowl
of shredded wheat paste.

171
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,239
Hola, nerd-migos.

172
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,786
Why do you people hate sleep?

173
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,538
Are you wearing my robe?

174
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,167
Oh, yeah. Sorry, I'll have it cleaned.

175
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,670
That's okay, keep it.

176
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,881
-Where's Christy?
-In the shower.

177
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,384
By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?

178
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,136
Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.

179
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,518
You used my loofah?

180
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,104
More precisely, we used your loofah.

181
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,898
I exfoliated her brains out.

182
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,985
You can keep that too.

183
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,657
Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.

184
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,244
Howard?
- In here, milady.

185
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:49,082
Mm. There's my little engine that could.

186
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,589
There's one beloved children's book
I'll never read again.

187
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,175
Hi. Christy.

188
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,969
-Hey, Leonard.
-I'm Sheldon.

189
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,346
Right. You're Howard's entourage.

190
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,767
So, Christy, what are your plans?

191
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:11,354
Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.

192
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:15,233
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.

193
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,361
Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.

194
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,613
Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.

195
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,825
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.

196
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,453
Let me offer a little thinking here.

197
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,748
-Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
-You live with your mother.

198
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,584
I do not. My mother lives with me.

199
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,297
It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.

200
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,883
And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...

201
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,136
...although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother?

202
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,849
-Sheldon, you just can't dictate--
-No more talking. Everybody go.

203
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,437
So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?

204
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,148
What is that, like a Mexican deli?

205
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,525
I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.

206
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,402
My last name is Wolowitz.

207
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,155
Oh. That's so cool.

208
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,699
My first Jew.

209
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,247
I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.

210
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,294
-But you're still taking me shopping?
-Anything you want.

211
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,797
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.

212
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,928
When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.

213
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,765
Howard, can't you see she's using you?

214
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,227
Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.

215
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,062
Look, Howard, I know her, okay?

216
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,649
She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.

217
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,526
-Really?
-Yeah.

218
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,069
Yay.

219
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:48,159
If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.

220
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,837
I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

221
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,923
We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?

222
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,383
Let me walk you through it.

223
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,261
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...

224
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:08,555
...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...

225
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,099
...shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.

226
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,184
Do you see the problem?

227
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,604
I see a problem.

228
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,400
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrées...

229
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,069
...divided amongst four people.

230
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,073
So we'll just order three entrées.

231
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,825
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?

232
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,911
-And who gets the extra dumpling?
-We could cut it into thirds.

233
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,538
Then it's no longer a dumpling.

234
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:37,500
Once you cut it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.

235
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,252
Hi, fellas.

236
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,048
Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?

237
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,634
He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.

238
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:49,178
Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.

239
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,557
I come from Sacramento.

240
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,897
Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?

241
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,607
No substitutions.

242
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,151
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.

243
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,737
Okay. No reductions.

244
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,990
Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.

245
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,618
-That's 12, we'll each have four.
-That works.

246
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,287
If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entrée.

247
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,663
No eliminations.

248
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,500
If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.

249
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,296
And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.

250
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,923
Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.

251
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,675
If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had your fourth.

252
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,552
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?

253
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,013
She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.

254
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,892
-We don't order egg rolls.
-Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.

255
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,518
Can we please make a decision?

256
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:42,106
Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.

257
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,693
There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?

258
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,612
Oh, ew.

259
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,530
You're nice boys.

260
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,992
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.

261
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,869
When I'm walking over to the table...

262
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,914
...maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.

263
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,123
No one has to know.

264
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,085
I'll know.

265
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,551
-How about soup?
-Yeah, we can always divide soup.

266
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,220
What about the won tons?

267
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,228
Oh. Hey, guys, what's up?

268
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,397
It's "Halo" night.

269
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,649
Yeah? Okay.

270
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,860
So?

271
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,364
With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy--

272
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,535
She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.

273
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,331
Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...

274
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,917
...we had something
we wanted to ask you.

275
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,003
-Sheldon?
-Yes. Ahem.

276
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,800
Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...

277
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,594
...if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.

278
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,433
I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.

279
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,020
Oh. That's so sweet.

280
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:04,230
But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.

281
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,691
You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.

282
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,235
Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.

283
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,362
-You go dancing every Wednesday?
-No.

284
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,822
Then it's not dancing night.

285
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,325
Why don't I play with you tomorrow?

286
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,954
Tonight is "Halo" night.
It's like talking to a wall.

287
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,500
All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

288
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,421
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.

289
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,340
Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.

290
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,801
All right, fellas, I gotta go.

291
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,054
But good luck.

292
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,435
Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.

293
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,812
Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...

294
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,856
...there are three of us and two of them.

295
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:51,319
-So?
-It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.

296
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,489
I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...

297
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:58,910
...compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.

298
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,539
For God's sakes, Sheldon,
you are driving me crazy.

299
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,042
Your anger is not with me,
but with mathematics.

300
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm pretty sure my anger is with you.

301
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,838
What is happening to us?
We're falling apart.

302
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,009
-Who are you calling?
-The only man who can restore...

303
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,678
...any semblance of balance
to our universe.

304
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,347
This is Howard.

305
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,015
CHRISTY
This is Christy.

306
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,936
We can't get to the phone
right now because we're having sex.

307
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,398
You're not gonna put that
on your message, are you?

308
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,317
I'm just kidding. I'll re-record it.

309
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,531
Sheldon, think this through.

310
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,700
You're going to ask Howard
to choose between sex and "Halo."

311
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,538
No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

312
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,124
As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...

313
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,460
...to include hi-def graphics
and enhanced weapon systems.

314
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:53,256
You're right, all sex has is nudity,
orgasms and human contact.

315
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,383
My point.

316
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:59,595
I'm just saying you can take the
damn plastic off the couch once in a while.

317
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,889
Why, so you
and Howard can hump on it?

318
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,060
Ladies, ladies,
I'm sure there's a middle ground.

319
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,479
- Shut up, Howard!
- Shut up, Howard!

320
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,899
You guys talk.
I'm gonna take my scooter out for a spin.

321
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,318
You happy?
You drove your son out of the house.

322
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,237
Why don't you stop butting in?

323
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,407
-What are you guys doing here?
-It's "Halo" night.

324
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,409
He's not a man, he's a putz.

325
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,828
And don't you take that tone with me,
you gold digger.

326
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,039
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me.

327
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,749
You're barking up the wrong tree...

328
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:32,003
...because as long as you're around,
Howard is out of the will.

329
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,423
You know what?
I got better offers. I'm out of here.

330
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,427
That's right.
Go back to Babylon, you whore.

331
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,849
So "Halo" night, huh?

332
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,937
-I thought she was the whore of Omaha.
-Shh.

333
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:59,280
Sheldon, you got him in your sights. Fire!
He's charging his plasma rifle.

334
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,241
-I can't shoot now, I'm cloaking.
-Now, Raj, kill Sheldon.

335
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,451
I can't see him.

336
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,120
That's why they call it cloaking,
dead man.

337
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:09,040
-Start throwing grenades.
-I'm all out.

338
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,959
Hey, guys, my friends and I
got tired of dancing...

339
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,378
...so we came over to have sex
with you.

340
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,047
Now, Raj, jump in the tank.

341
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,258
-We said no tanks.
-There are no rules in hell.

342
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,637
Son of a bitch.
Med-pack! I need a med-pack!

343
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,723
Told you.

344
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,142
There's a sniper.
Use your rocket launcher.

345
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,561
All I've got is a needler
and I'm all out of ammo!

346
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,481
And now you're out of life.

347
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,986
-Why did you hit pause?
-I thought I heard something.

348
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,155
-What?
-No-- Never mind.

349
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,990
Sorry, go.
