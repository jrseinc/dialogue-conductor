1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:05,004
Here you go. Pad Thai, no peanuts.

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,422
Does it have peanut oil?

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:07,631
I'm not sure.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,760
Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

5
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:15,097
Since it's not bee season,
you can have my epinephrine.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,350
-Any chopsticks?
-Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,852
Here we go.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,147
Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 1 9th century.

9
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:27,067
They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon. ..

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,445
. ..which then goes into their mouth.

11
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:32,114
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:34,950
I'll get it.

13
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,786
Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.

14
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:40,247
-Hey, Leonard.
-Oh, hi, Penny.

15
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,457
-Am I interrupting?
-No.

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:43,083
You're not swelling, Howard.

17
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,586
No, look at my fingers,
they're like Vienna sausages.

18
00:00:46,254 --> 00:00:49,506
-Sounds like you have company.
-They're not going anywhere.

19
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,135
So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

20
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,054
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory...

21
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,556
. ..people order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:02,728
So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

23
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,231
Yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,650
Yeah.

25
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,736
I was wondering
if you could help me out--

26
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,030
-Yes.
-Oh.

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,532
Okay, great, I’m having
some furniture delivered...

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,035
. ..and I may not be here, so, oh--

29
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,329
Hello.

30
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:25,667
I'm sorry?

31
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,171
Haven't you ever been told
how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?

32
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,924
-No, I haven't.
-Get used to it.

33
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,176
Yeah, I probably won't.

34
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,303
-Hey, Sheldon.
-Hi.

35
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,180
Hey, Raj.

36
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,475
Still not talking to me, huh?

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,685
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.

38
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,647
-He can't talk to women.
-He can't talk to attractive women.

39
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,316
Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.

40
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,444
-There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
-Yeah.

41
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,198
If it gets here and I’m not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?

44
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,038
-Penny, wait.
-Yeah?

45
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,791
Um....

46
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,043
If you don't have any other plans...

47
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,380
. ..do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?

48
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,341
A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?

49
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,636
You're kidding, right?

50
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,514
I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...

51
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,974
. ..and Superman catches her.

52
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,560
-Which one was that?
-One.

53
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,564
You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?

54
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,482
Yes, I know, men can't fly.

55
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,151
No, let's assume that they can.

56
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,237
Lois Lane is falling.

57
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,865
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.

58
00:02:38,032 --> 00:02:41,076
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.

59
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,995
Miss Lane, who is now traveling...

60
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,581
. ..at approximately
1 20 miles an hour, hits them...

61
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,709
. ..and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.

62
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:53,422
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.

63
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,299
In what space, sir? In what space?

64
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,884
She's 2 feet above the ground.

65
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,095
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.

66
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,598
-It would be a more merciful death.
-That doesn't--

67
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,518
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption. ..

68
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,021
. ..that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.

69
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,606
Are you listening to yourself?

70
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,941
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.

71
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,360
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings. . .

72
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,654
. ..an ability he derives
from exposure to sun--

73
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,698
How does he fly at night?

74
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,992
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...

75
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,204
. ..and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.

76
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,290
I'm just gonna go wash up.

77
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,292
I have 2600 comic books in there.

78
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,046
I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.

79
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,465
Challenge accepted.

80
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,719
We're locked out.

81
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,055
Also, the pretty girl left.

82
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,331
Okay.

83
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,751
Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna--

84
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,462
Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.

85
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,676
-I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
-I hardly think so.

86
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,803
Why not?

87
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,554
Well, we don't have a dolly. . .

88
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,475
. ..or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

89
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,311
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.

90
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,814
We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.

91
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,525
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.

92
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,361
It's just a matter-- I don't have this!
I do not have this!

93
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,073
Archimedes would be so proud.

94
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,580
Do you have any ideas?

95
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,875
Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

96
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,964
Easy. Easy.

97
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,803
Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.

98
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:08,432
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...

99
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,475
. ..call it 30 degrees, so about half.

100
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,105
Exactly half.

101
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,400
Let's push.

102
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,778
Okay.

103
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,031
See, it's moving. This is easy.

104
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,615
It's all in the math.

105
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,244
-What's your formula for the corner?
-What?

106
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,707
Oh, okay.

107
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:38,962
Okay, yeah, no problem.
Just come up here, help me pull and turn.

108
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,970
Oh, gravity, thou art a heatless bitch.

109
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,098
You do understand
that our efforts here. . .

110
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:54,770
. ..will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?

111
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,814
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

112
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,067
Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

113
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,653
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.

114
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,991
In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

115
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,789
Almost there.

116
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,624
- Almost there.
- No, we're not.

117
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,001
-No, we're not. No, we're not.
-I'm sorry.

118
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,587
-Watch your fingers.
-Yeah.

119
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,215
Oh, God, my fingers!

120
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,968
-You okay?
-No, it hurt--

121
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,347
Great Caesar's ghost, look at this place.

122
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,392
So Penny is a little messy.

123
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,227
A little messy?

124
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,313
The Mandelbrot set
of complex numbers is a little messy.

125
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,606
This is chaos.

126
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,733
Excuse me.

127
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,193
Explain to me a system. ..

128
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,530
. ..where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?

129
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,657
I'm just inferring that this is a couch...

130
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,786
. ..because the evidence suggests
the coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

131
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,998
Did it occur to you that not everyone
has the compulsive need to sort. ..

132
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,626
. ..organize and label
the entire world around them?

133
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,129
No.

134
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,297
Well, they don't.

135
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,924
Hard as it may be to believe...

136
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,595
. ..most people don't sort their breakfast
cereal numerically by fiber content.

137
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,349
Excuse me, but I think
we've both found that helpful at times.

138
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,813
-Come on, we should go.
-Hang on.

139
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,650
-What are you doing?
-I'm straightening up.

140
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,694
Sheldon, this is not your home.

141
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,448
This is not anyone's home.
This is a swirling vortex of entropy.

142
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,703
When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

143
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,079
Because it was immaculate.

144
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,248
I mean, you open that man's closet. . .

145
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:43,712
. ..it was left to right, evening gowns,
cocktail dresses and his police uniforms.

146
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,091
-What were you doing in his closet?
-I helped him run some cable for a webcam.

147
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,051
-Hey, guys.
-Oh, hey, Penny.

148
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,345
This just arrived.
Brought this up. Just now.

149
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,723
Great. Was it hard getting up the stairs?

150
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,057
-No.
-No?

151
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,895
-No.
-No.

152
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,063
-We’ll get out of your hair.
-Okay, great.

153
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,274
Thank you again.

154
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,944
Penny?

155
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,989
I just want you to know
that you don't have to live like this.

156
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,783
I'm here for you.

157
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,245
What's he talking about?

158
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,998
-It's a joke.
-I don't get it.

159
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,583
Yeah, he didn't tell it right.

160
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:48,318
Sheldon?

161
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,697
Hello?

162
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,972
- Sheldon?
- Shh!

163
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,641
Penny's sleeping.

164
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,186
Are you insane?

165
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,982
You can't break into a woman's apartment
in the middle of the night and clean.

166
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,149
I had no choice.

167
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,820
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room. . .

168
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,281
. ..and outside our living room
was that hallway...

169
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,742
. ..and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

170
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,912
Do you realize that if Penny wakes up...

171
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,915
. ..there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

172
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,835
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

173
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,796
No, no. You gave me an explanation.

174
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:53,300
It's reasonableness will be determined
by a jury of your peers.

175
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,761
Don't be ridiculous. I have no peers.

176
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,805
Sheldon, we have to get out of here.

177
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,936
You might want to speak
in a lower register.

178
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,771
What?

179
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,400
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep.. .

180
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,694
. ..so that they’ll be roused
by a crying baby.

181
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,948
If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

182
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,200
That's ridiculous!

183
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:27,042
No, that's ridiculous.

184
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,254
Fine.

185
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,342
I accept your premise.
Now, please let's go.

186
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,511
-I'm not leaving until I’m done.
-Oh, no.

187
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,852
If you have time to lean,
you have time to clean.

188
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,316
Oh, what the hell.

189
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,116
Good morning.

190
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,868
Morning.

191
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,372
I have to say I slept splendidly.

192
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,750
Granted not long,
but just deeply and well.

193
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,959
I'm not surprised.

194
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,920
A well-known folk cure for insomnia...

195
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,881
. ..is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.

196
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,425
Sarcasm?

197
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:18,760
You think?

198
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,055
Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

199
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,016
. ..but the end result
will be a measurable enhancement. . .

200
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,935
. ..to Penny's quality of life.

201
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,605
You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

202
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:33,692
-You don't think that crosses a line?
-Yes.

203
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,318
For God's sake, Sheldon...

204
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,280
. ..do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign
every time I open my mouth?

205
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,283
You have a sarcasm sign?

206
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,621
No, I do not have a sarcasm sign.

207
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,206
You want some cereal?

208
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,835
I feel so good today, I'm gonna choose
from the low-fiber end of the shelf.

209
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,295
Hello, Honey Puffs.

210
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,506
Son of a bitch!

211
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,300
Penny's up.

212
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,512
You sick, geeky bastards!

213
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,473
How did she know it was us?

214
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,102
I may have left
a suggested organizational schematic...

215
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,979
. ..for her bedroom closet.

216
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,147
Leonard?

217
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,440
This is gonna be bad.

218
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,735
Goodbye, Honey Puffs. Hello, Big Bran.

219
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,529
You came into my apartment
while I was sleeping?

220
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,864
Yes, but only to clean.

221
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,534
Really more to organize,
you're not actually dirty, per se.

222
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,870
Give me back my key.

223
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,830
I'm very, very sorry.

224
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,291
Do you understand how creepy this is?

225
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,501
Yes, we discussed it at length last night.

226
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,171
In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

227
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,340
And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.

228
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,094
But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.

229
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,557
The throat doctor.

230
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,187
And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

231
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,063
Depending on the depth.. .

232
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:59,486
. ..that's either a proctologist,
or a general surgeon.

233
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,994
Oh.

234
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,246
-God!
-Okay, look. No, Penny--

235
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,291
I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today. . .

236
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,669
. ..when you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...

237
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,379
. ..maybe we can talk about this.

238
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,007
-Stay away from me.
-Sure. That's another way to go.

239
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,218
Penny, Penny, hold on.

240
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,719
Just to clarify. . .

241
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,765
. ..because there will be a discussion
when you leave.

242
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,894
Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping. ..

243
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:37,649
. ..or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?

244
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,157
Well, that was a little non-responsive.

245
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:49,869
You are going to march yourself
over there right now and apologize.

246
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,209
What's funny?

247
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,336
That wasn't sarcasm?

248
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,380
-No!
-Whoo.

249
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,842
Boy, you are all over the place
this morning.

250
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,807
I have a Master's and two Ph.Ds,
I should not have to do this.

251
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,600
What?

252
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,103
I'm truly sorry
for what happened last night.

253
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,105
I take full responsibility.

254
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,858
I hope that it won't color
your opinion of Leonard...

255
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:26,114
. ..who is not only a wonderful guy,
but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.

256
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,128
I did what I could.

257
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,009
Hey, Raj.

258
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,475
Hey, I don't know if you heard about
what happened with Leonard and Sheldon...

259
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,311
. ..but I’m really upset about it.

260
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,647
I mean, they let themselves into my place,
and then they cleaned it.

261
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,609
Can you even believe that?
How weird is that?

262
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,028
She's standing very close to me.

263
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,655
Oh,, my. She does smell good.

264
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:10,158
What is that? Vanilla?

265
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,326
You know?

266
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,704
Where I come from, someone comes
into your house at night, you shoot.

267
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,664
Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.

268
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:21,502
I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

269
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,713
What was I saying?

270
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,506
She's so chatty.

271
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,303
Maybe my parents were right.
Maybe I'd be better off with an Indian girl.

272
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,347
We'd have
the same cultural background...

273
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:36,017
...and my wife could sing to my children
the lullabies my mother sang to me.

274
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,602
It's obvious they meant well.

275
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,854
I'm having a really rough time.
Like I said.. .

276
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,357
. .. I broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.

277
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:50,490
I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...

278
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,660
. ..doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.

279
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,161
Right?

280
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:58,206
She asked me a question.
I should probably nod.

281
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:01,584
That's exactly what I thought.

282
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,087
Thank you for listening. You're a doll.

283
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,633
Uh-oh. Turn your pelvis.

284
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:25,066
Grab a napkin, homey,
you just got served.

285
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,778
It's fine. You win.

286
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,739
What's his problem?

287
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,909
His imaginary girlfriend
broke up with him.

288
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,413
Been there.

289
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,416
Hello.

290
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,003
Sorry I’m late,
but I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny.

291
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,587
Really? You?

292
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,923
Rajesh Koothrappali spoke to Penny?

293
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,135
Actually,
I was less the chatter than the chattee.

294
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,637
What did she say? Is she still mad at me?

295
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,264
Well, she was upset at first...

296
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,934
. ..but probably
because her sister shot somebody.

297
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:05,148
Then there was something about you,
and then she hugged me.

298
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:08,609
She hugged you? How did she hug you?

299
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,953
Is that her perfume I smell?

300
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,290
Intoxicating, isn't it?

301
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,434
-Hi.
-Oh.

302
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,144
What's going on?

303
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,354
Uh. . ..

304
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,482
Here's the thing:

305
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:57,575
"Penny, just as Oppenheimer came to regret
his contributions to the first atomic bomb. ..

306
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,994
. ..so too I regret my participation
in what was...

307
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,955
. ..at the very least, an error in judgment.

308
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:06,167
The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

309
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,586
. ..is the willingness
to recognize one's mistakes.

310
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,507
Madam Curie's discovery of radium
turned out to have great potential. . .

311
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,969
. ..even though she would later die a slow,
painful death from radiation poisoning.

312
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,307
Another example,
from the field of Ebola research--"

313
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,017
Leonard.

314
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,769
Yeah?

315
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,856
We're okay.

316
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,336
Six two-inch dowels?
- Check.

317
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,755
-One package Philips head screws?
-Check.

318
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,882
Guys, seriously, I grew up
on a farm, okay?

319
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,260
I rebuilt a tractor engine
when I was, like, 1 2.

320
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,012
I think I can put together
a cheap Swedish media center.

321
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,015
Please, we insist.
It's the least we can do, considering--

322
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,267
Considering what?

323
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,270
How great this place looks?

324
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,064
-Oh, boy, I was afraid of this.
-What?

325
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,733
These instructions
are a pictographic representation.. .

326
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,736
. ..of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

327
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,739
This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

328
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,161
-It looked pretty good in the store.
-It is an inefficient design.

329
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,912
For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV. . .

330
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,123
. ..which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

331
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,917
-We could put her stereo back there.
-And control it how?

332
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:34,380
Run an infrared repeater,
photocell here, emitter here, easy-peasy.

333
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,466
-Good point. How will you cool it?
-Guys, I got this.

334
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,802
-Hang on, Penny.
-How about fans?

335
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,389
-Here and here.
-Also inefficient, and might be loud.

336
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,100
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

337
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,768
Run some quarter-inch PVC--

338
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,770
Guys, this is actually really simple.

339
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,106
Hold on, honey, men at work.

340
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,945
PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here.

341
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,574
Show me where we put a drip tray,
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

342
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,660
If water's involved,
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

343
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,497
Guys, it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

344
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,962
Oh, I’ve got it.

345
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:20,718
What if we replaced panels A, B and F and
crossbar H with aircraft-grade aluminum?

346
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,054
-Entire thing's one big heat sink.
-Perfect.

347
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,807
Leonard and Sheldon, go to the junkyard
and pick up 6 square meters of aluminum.

348
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,769
-Raj and I will get the oxyacetylene torch.
-Meet in an hour?

349
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,687
-Done.
-Got it.

350
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,859
Okay, this place does look pretty good.
