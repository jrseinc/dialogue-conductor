On the other hand, some physicists are
concerned that if this supercollider works...

...it'll create a black hole and swallow up
the Earth, ending life as we know it.

Why would they be looking
for test subjects here?

I don't know, Raj.

11
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:36,952
Maybe the comic-book store
doesn't have a bulletin board.

- Shh! Hot girl in Sheldon's office.

I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

- Maybe she's his lawyer.
- Well, she's free to examine my briefs.

- Howard...
- I know, I'm disgusting.

18

- Oh, all right. This is Missy.

Missy, this is Leonard and Rajesh,
and you've already met Howard.

00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,732
- It's nice to meet you.
- You too, as well also.

00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,275
Yeah.

She's my twin sister.

38
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,168
She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.

39
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,130
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.

40
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,799
How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?

41
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,093
A humormometer?

00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,266

So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

48
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,625
Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

49
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,877
My friend's getting married at Disneyland.

50
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,339
Destiny, thy name is Anaheim.

51
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,177
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,847
The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?

53
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,308
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.

54
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,144
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.

55

Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.

61

Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.

62
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,753
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

Look, you're here,
and we have plenty of room.

64
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,969
- No, we don't.
- Come on, Shelly, she's family.

65
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,555
So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.

66
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,892
It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.

67

And don't ever call me Shelly.

68

00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,212

our own separate ways.
